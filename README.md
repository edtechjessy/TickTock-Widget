# Tick-Tock Widget
## Project Explanation
I‚Äôm working on a minimalist desktop live wallpaper üñ•Ô∏è to display two clocks:

1. CT Time üï∞Ô∏è (Central Time) ‚Äì for the schools I work with online üè´


2. S√£o Paulo Time ‚è∞ (SP Time) ‚Äì for where I currently live üåé


I wanted a quick visual reference for these two time zones when I open my laptop üíª. It‚Äôs designed to be simple, beige, and include a cute catüê± to make it more fun and personal! This personalized project will help me keep track of my teaching schedule and the time in my current location, *all with a visual glance when I open my laptop*.

## Customizing Times
#### **_First Clone the Github Repository_**

1. **Identify the correct time zone name**  
   Look up the correct IANA time zone string (like `America/Sao_Paulo` for S√£o Paulo or `Asia/Tokyo` for Tokyo).
  [Click here to find your IANA Time Zones of Interest](https://www.addevent.com/c/documentation/tools/time-zone-lookup)

3. **Update your code**  
   Replace the existing time zone string in the code with the new one, depending on which region you want the time to display.

## How I created an Image using Cava AI and You can too :) 

Creating an image with Canva AI is a straightforward and creative process. Here's how you can do it based on my own experience:  

1. **Access Canva AI Tools**  
 https://www.canva.com/ai-image-generator/

![free generator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35f42906-2ada-4bc6-bd5e-0334caf7f08b)

3. **Choose Your Wording**  
   Start by thinking about the text prompt that describes the image you want. Be specific about the theme, mood, or key elements you want in the design. For example, you can describe the style, objects, and color palette.

5. **Pick the Style**  
   Canva AI allows you to select from various styles like realistic, cartoonish, abstract, or even specific art movements. Choose a style that fits your vision for the image.

7. **Run the Generator**  
   Enter your text prompt and let the AI create an image for you. If the first result doesn‚Äôt match what you‚Äôre envisioning, tweak the wording or refine your style preferences and run it again.

9. **Refine Your Results**  
   Don‚Äôt hesitate to do multiple reruns until the AI generates an image you‚Äôre happy with. Experimentation is key to achieving the desired result.

11. **Save and Use**  
   Once you've created an image you love, save it to your device and upload it to your github repository. Name upload "image.mpg".

By following this process, I was able to create an image I liked by carefully choosing my words, picking a style, and rerunning the generator until it felt just right. Have fun experimenting with Canva's AI to bring your ideas to life!
