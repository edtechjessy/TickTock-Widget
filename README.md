# Tick-Tock Widget
## Project Explanation
I’m working on a minimalist desktop widget 🖥️ to display two clocks:

1. CT Time 🕰️ (Central Time) – for the schools I work with online 🏫


2. São Paulo Time ⏰ (SP Time) – for where I currently live 🌎



I wanted a quick visual reference for these two time zones when I open my laptop 💻. It’s designed to be simple, beige, and include some cute cats 🐱 to make it more fun and personal!

This widget will help me keep track of my teaching schedule and the time in my current location, all with a visual glance when I open my laptop.
