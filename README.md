# Tick-Tock Widget
## Project Explanation
I’m working on a minimalist desktop widget 🖥️ to display two clocks:

1. CT Time 🕰️ (Central Time) – for the schools I work with online 🏫


2. São Paulo Time ⏰ (SP Time) – for where I currently live 🌎



I wanted a quick visual reference for these two time zones when I open my laptop 💻. It’s designed to be simple, beige, and include some cute cats 🐱 to make it more fun and personal!

This widget will help me keep track of my teaching schedule and the time in my current location, all with a visual glance when I open my laptop.

Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the widget running on your local machine and display it on your desktop.

Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following tools installed:

Node.js (if you want to package the widget into an Electron app for the desktop)
