## Project Explanation  
I‚Äôm working on a minimalist desktop live wallpaper üñ•Ô∏è to display two clocks:  

1. **CT Time üï∞Ô∏è** (Central Time) ‚Äì for the schools I work with online üè´  
2. **S√£o Paulo Time ‚è∞** (SP Time) ‚Äì for where I currently live üåé  

I wanted a quick visual reference for these two time zones when I open my laptop üíª. It‚Äôs designed to be simple, beige, and include a cute cat üê± to make it more fun and personal! This personalized project will help me keep track of my teaching schedule and the time in my current location‚Äî*all with a visual glance when I open my laptop.*

## Customizing the Times  
### **Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository**  

1. **Find the Correct Time Zone Name**  
   - Look up the correct IANA time zone string (e.g., `America/Sao_Paulo` for S√£o Paulo or `Asia/Tokyo` for Tokyo).  
   - Use this [IANA Time Zone Lookup Tool](https://www.addevent.com/c/documentation/tools/time-zone-lookup).  

2. **Update Your Code**  
   - Replace the existing time zone string in the code with the one for your desired region.

## Customizing the Image  
### How I Created an Image with Canva AI  

1. **Access Canva's AI Image Generator**  
   - Use Canva's AI tool: [https://www.canva.com/ai-image-generator/](https://www.canva.com/ai-image-generator/).

3. **Choose Your Wording**  
   Start by thinking about the text prompt that describes the image you want. Be specific about the theme, mood, or key elements you want in the design. For example, you can describe the style, objects, and color palette.

11. **Save** 
   Once you've created an image you love, save it to your device.

and upload it to your github repository. Name your image:
insertname.jpg 

By following this process, I was able to create an image I liked by carefully choosing my words, picking a style, and rerunning the generator until it felt just right. Have fun experimenting with Canva's AI to bring your ideas to life!
